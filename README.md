# Quantum Circuits: Quantum Teleportation

This repository contains an implementation of quantum teleportation using Qiskit, demonstrating how to transmit a quantum state from one qubit to another using quantum entanglement and classical communication.

### Overview

## Project Evolution
I decided to make the following changes to improve its accuracy:

### What Changed?
1. **Cleaned Up the Model**

The original project used a far more complicated CNN architecture than was necessary. The new architecture took the form:
     ```python
   model = models.Sequential([
        # First Convolutional Block
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        
        # Second Convolutional Block
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        
        # Third Convolutional Block
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        
        # Flatten and Dense Layers
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dropout(0.5),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
Keeping the architecture neat and focused.

2. **Improved Training Data**
   Initially the model was only trained on quantum states from n = 1 to n = 5, which only consisted of 35 images. The new model was trained on n = 1 to n = 7, increasing the training data to 89 images, however this is still a comparably small data set.

## The Process:

The training data was created using the file "electron_orbitals.ipynb" which plots the electrons probability density according to the quantum numbers n, l and m and the radial/ angular functions. Images were created for all (n, l, m) states from n = 1 to n = 7.

The training data is then loaded into the file "improved-electron-orbital-classifier.ipynb", the CNN is constructed, and the model is trained upon the data. The test data is then loaded in, and the model attempts to predict the prinicple quantum number based off the test image.

## Results
The model shows significant improvement from my previous attempt. Where before it struggled to classify orbitals within its own training set, this version successfully identifies principle quantum numbers of test images, demonstrating it has learned meaningful features from the training data. It appears to be accurate almost all of the time, with exceptions for very similar-looking quantum states e.g. (1, 0, 0) and (2, 0, 0).

## What's Next?

Moving forward, I would like to explore baking the quantum mechanical equations into the architecture of the model to created a Physics-informed ML model that will be able to accurately classify not just the principle quantum number n, but the angular and magnetic quantum states l and m too.
